## 🧃 Description

A simple plugin requested by **Lumien** for **SCP: Secret Laboratory**, built using **EXILED**.

### 🚀 Features

- When a player drinks **3 SCP-207 colas**, they receive a speed boost.
- Upon drinking a **4th cola**, the speed remains the same **but they no longer take damage**.
- The **maximum speed** from cola consumption is configurable via the `config` file.

### ⚙️ Configuration

You can modify the speed boost and cola effects in the plugin's configuration file.  
This allows server owners to balance gameplay according to their needs.

---

## 📥 Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Konoaru384/SuperCola/releases) page.
2. Place the plugin `.dll` file into your server's `plugins` directory.
3. Restart your server to apply changes.
4. Tweak the `config.yml` if needed.
